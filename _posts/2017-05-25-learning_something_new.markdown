Ah my journey to a new career. I've become a bit unsatisfied with my current career and I'm always looking for more things to learn. This seems like my cup of tea. When I was a teen, I used to make Xanga and myspace layouts and it was a ton of fun and I really enjoyed doing it. But alas, when I got to college I really wanted to be a doctor but things didn't turn out the way I wanted them to just like many individuals.

I realized I wanted to do something more with my life and not waste my time in a clinical lab where you don't learn as much and the potential to grow is limited. I definitely wanted something more. I found my way back to coding and making websites and now here I am trying to learn all the skills I need to be a web developer and even a software engineer when I get my masters degree.

I'm looking forward to learning more about full stack web development and moving on to a new career! :)

Excitinggggg!
